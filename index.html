      <p>Information systems are subject to serious threats that can harm your business reputation and damage your company’s bottom line.  Those threats exploit vulnerabilities in order to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your private business data. An information security policy describes the controls that are applied to mitigate vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>An assessment is a analysis of the threat and vulnerability in operations of the network and prioritizing the risk to cybersecurity.</p>

        <h2>Your Business Must Manage Risk to Succeed</h2>
        <p>People learn and grow from taking chances&mdash;so do businesses. No business network is totally secure, but most breaches are avoidable without difficult or expensive action. Small businesses have limited resources and they must thoughtfully manage their risk to thrive. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h2>Align Your Defenses with a Cybersecurity Assessment</h2>
        <p>A cyber security assessment helps businesses to evaluate the effectiveness of their current policy controls, so they can effectively manage risk. It is part of a larger overall business risk management process.</p>
        <p>As an outside cyber security assessor, JSW4NET can help you to accurately and impartially measure how well you are implementing your information security policy and provide a clear assessment of risk. We have years of experience working with many diverse small business networks, so we are uniquely positioned to understand the challenges and opportunities of scale. Our risk assessment service is based on the principles in NIST SP 800-30, “Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.”</p>
